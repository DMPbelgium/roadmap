- disable autocomplete on input field for organisations

  We do not want our users to add organisations

- Identifier with identifier_scheme for shibboleth and identifiable_type "User" is empty:

  prefill at upgrade time

- Contributors?

  automatically add contributors to the share tab, and merge the rights?
  what if someone removeds a contributor: what should happen to the rights?

  data contact and principal investigator not recognisable
  in plan.roles

- remove config/custom.yml?

  in that case, also remove load statement from config/initializers/ugent.rb
