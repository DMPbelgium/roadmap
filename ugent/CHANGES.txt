- column `answers.text` should be `MEDIUMTEXT` in mysql

  This is done during migration, and should make sure

  old data isn't lost.

  See branch `dmponline4_upgrade_step2_ugent`, migration file

  `20161122152339_new_plan_template_structure.rb`

- app/assets/images/favicon.ico

  overrides upstream version

  make sure to keep this one while merging with upstream repo

- app/javascript/packs/application.js

  replaced import of plans/new.js by ugent/plans/new.js (see further):

    -import '../src/plans/new';
    +import '../src/ugent/plans/new'; // ugent override

  make sure this replacement stays on upstream merge

- app/javascript/src/ugent/plans/new.js

  replacement for app/javascript/src/plans/new.js

  inserted into app/javascript/packs/application.js (see above)

  expected by override template app/views/branded/plans/new.html.erb (see below):
    expects #plan_org_id and #plan_funder_id to be select boxes,
    instead of autocomplete inputs!

- app/views/branded/plans/new.html.erb

  overrides app/views/plans/new.html.erb

  makes sure that research org id and funder id taken
  from a preselected list, and are presented in a select box

  IMPORTANT: both TemplateOptionsController#index and
             PlansController#create use an org selector
             that expects a hash with "id", "name" ..
             instead of just an id. Providing just "id"
             returns an empty match, because it does not
             match on "name" also (weird);

             that is why the values of select boxes
             plan[org][id] and plan[funder][id] contain
             JSON values!

- app/views/branded/shared/export/_plan.erb

  overrides app/views/shared/export/_plan.erb

  uses @selected_phases instead of @selected_phase
  as determined by overridden controller PlanExportsController.

  See config/initializer/ugent.rb

- app/views/branded/plans/_download_form.html.erb

  overrides app/views/plans/_download_form.html.erb

  in contrast to original, lets us select from multiple phases,
  disables download button when no phase is selected.

  expects array @selected_phases instead of original @selected_phase
  to be present

- app/views/branded/paginable/plans/_privately_visible.html.erb

  overrides app/views/paginable/plans/_privately_visible.html.erb

  adds column "owner", makes use of new method PlansHelper#display_user

- app/views/branded/org_admin/questions/_show.html.erb

  overrides app/views/org_admin/questions/_show.html.erb

    who these id's belong to

- app/views/branded/shared/export/_plan_styling.erb

  overrides app/views/shared/export/_plan_styling.erb

  adds css rules to style orcid links on html/docx/pdf export

  replaces intro text above

- app/views/branded/layouts/_footer.html.erb

  overrides app/views/branded/layouts/_footer.html.erb

  changes:

  * replaces link to github from https://github.com/DMPRoadmap/roadmap to
    https://github.com/DMPbelgium/roadmap

- config/initializers/wicked_pdf_ugent.rb

  sets path of wkhtmltopdf (like in DMPonline_v4)

- app/views/branded/org_admin/shared/_theme_selector.html.erb

  overrides app/views/org_admin/shared/_theme_selector.html.erb

  removes special themes from array "all_themes" so

  that these are not visible in the org admin interface.

  those invisible themes are added of course to the form

  as hidden inputs though

  Affected:

  * edit question

  * edit guidance

  Reason:

  * themes with title "UGENT:*" are ugent specific

  * themes with title "https://w3id.org/GDPRtEXT#*" are ugent specific

- app/views/branded/devise/registrations/edit.html.erb

  removed tab (and tab content) for password

- app/views/branded/devise/registrations/_personal_details.html.erb

  email: readonly (+class form-control-plaintext)
  org: readonly -> user[org_id] must be json according to RegistrationsController#update
  departments: removed
  languages: removed (translations limited anyway)

  #5 : remove Remove sentence about the email being used as username (commit: c187c851b60c8c408847e93bdd376397286b2d4c)
  #5 : only allow to edit orcid (commit: bb776cd52e79d957e6998e89aad56d4cb22dfe82)
  #5 : change text "You can edit any of the details below." to "Verify your profile details below."

- app/views/branded/layouts/_signin_signout.html.erb

  disabled language tab

  added link to /switch_user/edit

- config/initializers/ugent.rb

  * change firstname and surname to "N.N" during user invitation

    reason: roles_controller.rb sets firstname to "Firstname",
    and surname to "Surname", which is different from our approach,
    and would create two approaches to handling empty user fields.

  * add missing length validation to Plan#title

    cf. https://github.com/DMPbelgium/roadmap/issues/29
    cf. https://github.com/DMPRoadmap/roadmap/issues/3068

    without this one cannot save the plan with a title
    longer than 255 characters as the underlying table
    only allows for 255 characters

    remove when needed as soon as fixed upstream

  * add method Contributor#to_user that fetches
    user record, based on shared email attribute

  * add method User#orcid_logo, User#orcid_link and User#name_and_orcid.
    these methods are used in order to render an orcid link
    on the html/docx/pdf plan export

  * change PlanPolicy#create? so that users with Org "guests" cannot
      create plans

  * overrides method Identifier#value_uniqueness_with_scheme in such a way that

    * multiple shibboleth identifiers per org are possible (and therefore loginroutes)
    * multiple orcid identifiers per user are possible

  * overrides methods of Users::OmniauthCallbacksController

  * adds relation question_options_themes to QuestionOption

    this reuses an old (custom!) generated table options_themes,
    that was not part of DMPOnline_v4, but which we added ourselves.

    this way we can attach themes to question options

    These associations can only be read/updated in the RailsAdmin controller
    http://localhost:3000/admin/question_option

  * adds methods to model User:

    * alternative_accounts
    * nemo
    * ensure_password
    * guest?
    * set_org_by_email

  * skip invitation email, and clears invitation_token when you login

  * adds before_validation to model User:

    * prevent someone from editing email attribute
    * change attribute org_id based on old table organisation_domains (now: table ugent_org_domains)

  * adds method gdpr? to model Template:

    a template contains privacy related data
    if one of the questions contains the theme "UGENT:DATA"

  * adds methods Plan.ld_uri and Plan.ld

    See also:
      - app/controllers/ugent/internal/exports_controller.rb
      - app/models/ugent/rest_user.rb

  * adds method Plan#old_project_groups

    only used in Plan.ld (see above)

  * adds methods Org.internal_export_dir and Org.internal_export_url

    internal_export_dir: returns the directory for that organisation where its JSON exports are stored
    internal_export_url: return the base_url for that organisation's JSON exports

    only used in Plan.ld and Ugent::Internal::ExportsController

  * add hook User.after_save:

    copies firstname, surname and org_id to Contributor with same email

  * add hook Role.after_save:

    * creates Contributor with same email, org_id and name (if not exists) as role.user
    * copies orcid identifiers from role.user.identifiers

  * add hook Identifier.after_save:

    when an Identifier of model User is saved,
    and has scheme "orcid", then it is copied
    to all contributors with the same email as that user

  * adds Contributor.roles, a list of possible roles in class Contributor

  * adds Role.on_destroy that automatically removes Contributor with same email and plan_id

  * adds RolesController.after_action on method "create" that catches
    parameter "contributor" and creates a Contributor with same plan_id, email,
    and sets the rest of the attributes from role.user

  * adds PlanPolicy#update_role_with_contributor? for new controller method Ugent::RolesController#update_role_with_contributor

  * change download file name from sanitized title to "plan_<id>.pdf"
    see `PlanExportsController#file_name`

  * override `PlanExportsController#show` to make selection of multiple phases possible
    see also `Plan#as_csv`

- app/controllers/ugent/legacy/projects_controller.rb

  adds legacy routes to redirect

  /projects to /plans
  /projects/:id to /plans/:id

- app/controllers/ugent/selectable_user_controller.rb

  ugent specific controller

  when user authenticates with orcid,
  and this orcid matches with multiple users at this end,
  this controller shows a select box from which one
  can choose the user to login to

  this use case is necessary to accomodate for users
  that are part of multiple organisations,
  but for some reason only have orcid as a login method.

- app/controllers/ugent/switch_user_controller.rb

  ugent specific controller

  if a user has an orcid that matches with other user accounts
  he/she can switch to that other user account

  differences with selectable_user_controller.rb:
    * only the OTHER users accounts are shown in the select box
    * happens when already logged in

- app/controllers/ugent/internal/exports_controller.rb

  ugent specific controller (deprecated)

  provides access to JSON exports of plans per organisation in /opt/dmponline_internal

  authenticates with basic auth

  username and password is drawn from attributes "code" and "token" of model Ugent::RestUser respectively

  When removed, remove also:
    - methods Plan.ld_uri and Plan.ld_uri in config/initializers/ugent.rb
    - file lib/tasks/ugent_deprecated.rake
    - routes starting with /internal from config/routes/ugent.rb

- app/controllers/ugent/roles_controller.rb

  ugent specific controller

  added to routes in config/routes/ugent.rb

  extra route to update a plan role with an existing contributor together

  used in share tab of a plan in ugent branch

- app/models/ugent/rest_user.rb

  ugent specific model

  Stores authentication information for REST users that want to access Ugent::Internal::ExportsController

  ugent specific rake tasks

  deprecated

  to remove?

- lib/tasks/ugent_deprecated.rake

  ugent specific rake tasks

  generates JSON export of plans per organisation, and stores them in /opt/dmponline_internal

  See also:
    - app/controllers/ugent/internal/exports_controller.rb

    - app/models/ugent/rest_user.rb
    - config/initializers/ugent.rb
    - lib/tasks/ugent_deprecated.rake

- app/models/ugent/log.rb

  reuse old table "logs", now under the name "ugent_logs"
  Used in the past to track deleted "projects"

  Now one cannot delete plans anymore: the "remove" button
    simply removes all collaborators (plan.roles = [])
  Of course a plan can be removed in the CLI

  Still usefull?

- app/models/ugent/org_domain.rb

  reuse old table "organisation_domains",
  now under the name ugent_org_domains

  Can be edited in RailsAdmin by users with admin rights: http://localhost:3000/admin/ugent~org_domain

  See also:
    - rails_admin

- config/custom.yml

  adds ugent specific configuration toe

  not used at the moment

  if removed, also remove load statement from config/initializers/ugent.rb

- app/views/branded/orgs/_profile_form.html.erb

  overrides app/views/orgs/_profile_form.html.erb

  this partial is used both by /super_admin/orgs/new,
  and by /org/admin/:org_id/admin_edit.

  In the upstream
  version of this template, if this is a new record (used in /super_admin/orgs/new),
  then you have to select from a list provided by the ROR api;
  if it is an existing record (used by /org/admin/:org_id/admin_edit),
  then you may edit name and abbreviation manually.

  That last thing has been changed here as follows:

    * always show the input field for name and abbreviation

    * set html attributes of both fields to "required"

  disables partial app/views/orgs/_external_identifiers.html.erb

  with one could edit the org identifiers, which only allowed for
  one identifier per scheme. If you had multiple per scheme,
  it would only save one. e.g. Org "UGent" has two shibboleth identifiers

  Id management should be done in /admin/identifier

- app/views/branded/shared/_sign_in_form.html.erb
  app/views/branded/shared/_dev_sign_in_form.html.erb
  app/views/branded/shared/_access_controls.html.erb

  * replace login/registration form with list of org identifiers when production environment is on,
    otherwise load app/views/branded/shared/_dev_sign_in_form.html.erb (copy of original app/views/shared/_sign_in_form.html.erb)
    this makes it more suitable to login during development phase
  * if an organisation has multiple identifiers, then append the host name of that id

- app/views/branded/home/index.html.erb

  changed width of signin panel to give it more space

- config/initializers/_dmproadmap_ugent.rb

  overrides settings config/initializers/_dmproadmap.rb

  that _dmproadmap.rb is included in git,
  which makes it hard to configure it at the server

  also used to override default_url_options for action_mailer and controller

  as configured in config/application.rb

  Please set DMP_HOST and DMP_PROTOCOL in your environment

- config/initializers/devise_ugent.rb

  overrides settings from config/initializers/devise.rb

  adds fix for https://github.com/datacite/omniauth-orcid/issues/14

  adds fix for omniauth-shibboleth when attributes are passed by headers
    and they contain utf-8 characters

- config/initializers/contact_us.rb

  not included in .gitigore,
  and expected by roadmap to set (contact_us.rb.example not used)

- config/routes/*.rb

  add extra routes

  in order to load to extra files,
  I had to edit config/application.rb!

- app/views/branded/plans/index.html.erb

  overrides app/views/plans/index.html.erb

  reason: * override text above plans (switch to other user account)
          * hide link "Create plan" if user is not allowed to create plans (guest users)

- app/views/branded/orgs/admin_edit.html.erb

  overrides app/views/orgs/admin_edit.html.erb

  reason: disable tab schools/departments

- app/views/branded/plans/_share_form.html.erb

  edit section where you can set the visibility
  of the plan. In the upstream version you can set:
  * privately visible (default)
  * organisationally visible
  * publicly visible

  we removed the radio button to set "publicy visible"

  anyway, one can only change these if 50% of all questions are answered

  adds extra sentence: "Collaborators with permissions "co-owner" and "editor" will be mentioned as "principal investigator" and "project administrator" respectively on the plan"

- app/views/branded/plans/_navigation.html.erb

  hide link to tab "contributors"

- app/views/branded/layouts/_navigation.html.erb

  disable link to page /public_plans

  see previous

- app/views/branded/paginable/templates/_publicly_visible.html.erb

  overrides app/views/paginable/templates/_publicly_visible.html.erb

  hides link to plan creation wizard when PlanPolicy does not allow it
    see previous

  after a while we decided to hide the link to "create plan".
  reason: only the raw funder template is selected, while
          in the plan creation wizard one may receive
          the customized version of that funder template
          based on your chosen organisation

- app/views/branded/contributors/_form.html.erb

  overrides app/views/contributors/_form.html.erb

  removes field "phone"

  replaces shared/org_selector/combined by shared/org_selector/local_only
  because we only allow for local organisations

- app/views/branded/user_mailer/plan_visibility.html.erb

  overrides app/views/user_mailer/plan_visibility.html.erb

  removes list option for public plans (because we do not support)

  removes footer documentation about "My Dashboard"

- app/views/branded/user_mailer/_email_signature.html.erb

  overrides app/views/user_mailer/_email_signature.html.erb

  just changes the team name

- ugent/etc/systemd/roadmap.service

  Systemd Service file

  Copied to /etc/systemd/system at rpm build time

- ugent/etc/systemd/roadmap.conf

  Default EnvironmentFile, to be used in /etc/systemd/system/roadmap.service.
  Overrides must be put in /etc/sysconfig/roadmap.conf at the server.

  Note that `env.sh` in the root folder is also used.

- ugent/public/packs and ugent/public/assets

  precompiled assets for production mode
  this is generated at development time,
  so that it does not have to be generated when installed
  (and therefore should need nodejs, yarn and all that stuff)

  see also ugent/bin/build_assets

- ugent/bin/build_assets

  precompile all javascript and css assets
  in production mode, and copy them
  to ugent/public

  run this from the application directory

- add gem rails_admin to Gemfile.local

  In order to make it work I changed these things

  * changed gem "wicked_pdf" to higher version than 2.1.0 by pointing directly
    to the (unreleased) master branch

    gem 'wicked_pdf', git: "https://github.com/mileszs/wicked_pdf"

    Reason: when you try to access any page, the page load takes forever,
    and finally stops with an SystemStackError.

    See also: https://github.com/DMPRoadmap/roadmap/issues/2793

    a ruby crash report with something like "vm_call_cfunc - cfp consistency error"

    also to do with this.

  * config/initializes/rails_admin.rb

    this file does not exist in the external repo

    rails_admin tries to load all ruby files as models, for some reason (even the controllers)
    so make sure to explicitly include all allowed models via config.included_models

  * add assets rails_admin/rails_admin.js and rails_admin/rails_admin.css to the assets compilation pipeline

    see config/initializers/assets.rb
    that file already existed, so may conflict in the future.

- ugent/cron.d/roadmap.cron

  cronjob that is moved to /etc/cron.d/roadmap in the rpm

  internally used cronjobs are:

  * ugent/bin/daily_export_projects:

    * for every managed Org creates "<year>/<month>/projects_<timestamp>.json" in /opt/dmponline_internal/<org.abbrevation>

      this lists every "project" at that moment for that organisation

    * for every managed Org creates "<year>/<month>/updated_projects_<timestamp>.json" in /opt/dmponline_internal/<org.abbrevation>

      this lists every new "project" since the latest full dump (see above)

    * for every managed Org creates "<year>/<month>/projects_<timestamp>.json" in /opt/dmponline_internal/<org.abbrevation>

      this lists all deleted projects. Only id's are given.

  * ugent/bin/daily_cleanup_projects

    this makes that only a maximum of json export files per organisation are kept

    this maximum is 30 by default.

    this means that by default 30 full exports are kept

  only used for Sharepoint integration of UGent
